# COMP 472 Repository
We will use this repository to keep track our mini projects in COMP 472.

## Getting Started
We will be using Miniconda as our python environment. Go to the website to download it. The Miniconda version we downloaded is using a base python version of 3.9.12 
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Open a Miniconda terminal and install the following dependencies using the following command (Make sure your running the terminal as an administrator):
`conda install jupyter scikit-learn gensim nltk numpy pandas matplotlib`

Then open up the jupiter notebook **MP1** either by using your favorite IDE (VsCode or Pycharm) or by running the jupiter notebook using the following command in your miniconda terminal:
`cd <repo_path>`
`jupyter notebook`

### MP1
We used jupyter notebook, these files will be moved to MP1 once the assignment grades are given so as to not tamper with the results/paths of the files.

### MP2
MP2 folder will contain all the python code in the form of .py files. Use this command to use the terminal for running miniconda base environment `source C:/Users/mlope/miniconda3/Scripts/activate base`
